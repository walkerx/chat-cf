# Feature Specification: AI Chat (Streaming)

**Feature Branch**: `001-ai-chat-stream`  
**Created**: 2025-11-14  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "实现一个简单的ai聊天功能，支持流式输出"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - One-off question + streaming reply (Priority: P1)

A user sends a single message (question) and receives an AI-generated answer delivered incrementally (streaming) so the UI can display partial content as it arrives.

**Why this priority**: This is the core MVP user flow: rapid perceived latency and streaming output define user experience.

**Independent Test**: Send a request with a short prompt and verify the UI (or test client) receives an initial partial token within 1s and the full answer completes with a final end-of-stream marker.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an active session, **When** the user submits a message, **Then** the client begins receiving partial response chunks within 1 second and receives the final completion marker when the model finishes.
2. **Given** a malformed prompt, **When** the user submits it, **Then** the system returns an error chunk with a clear error code and the stream terminates cleanly.

---

### User Story 2 - Multi-turn conversation (Priority: P2)

A user continues a conversation within the same session; earlier messages are used as context to produce coherent follow-ups, with each reply delivered as a stream.

**Why this priority**: Multi-turn context increases usefulness; streaming still provides low-latency feedback.

**Independent Test**: Create a conversation, send multiple messages, and verify each response is streamed and references prior messages appropriately.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a conversation with two prior messages, **When** the user asks a follow-up, **Then** the streamed response reflects context from prior messages and completes successfully.

---

### User Story 3 - Interrupt / resume & cancellation (Priority: P3)

Users (or clients) can cancel an in-progress stream and optionally request the model to continue from where it left off.

**Why this priority**: Improves UX for long outputs and supports recovering from network issues.

**Independent Test**: Start a streaming response, issue a cancel signal, verify the stream ends promptly; then request a continuation and validate the subsequent stream resumes or re-produces an appropriate continuation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an active streaming response, **When** the client sends a cancel instruction, **Then** the server stops sending chunks and returns a cancellation confirmation.
2. **Given** a previously-cancelled response, **When** the client requests continuation with the same conversation ID, **Then** the system either resumes (if supported) or returns a new coherent reply that continues the conversation.

---

### Edge Cases

- Very short prompts that produce immediate completion (ensure streaming still emits at least one chunk).
- Extremely long outputs (ensure server truncates or streams until completion without blocking other sessions).
- Downstream AI provider errors (propagate an error chunk and terminate stream cleanly).
- Network interruptions: client reconnects and can request a replay or continuation according to server capabilities.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST accept a chat request containing: a conversation identifier (optional), a user message, and client metadata (e.g., client id, request id).
- **FR-002**: The system MUST return AI-generated output as a sequence of ordered stream chunks, plus a final completion marker when the model finishes.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST deliver the first response chunk within 1 second (perceived latency target) for typical short prompts under normal load.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST allow clients to cancel an in-progress stream and receive a confirmation of cancellation.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST support multi-turn context by accepting previous messages for the same conversation identifier and using them as context for subsequent responses.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST return structured error information in-stream when an error occurs (e.g., provider error, validation error), then terminate the stream gracefully.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST implement basic rate-limiting to prevent abuse (enforced at API/gateway level).

### Non-functional Requirements (MVP)

- **NFR-001**: Support at least 100 concurrent active streaming sessions with graceful degradation (MVP target — adjust based on infra capacity).
- **NFR-002**: Stream chunk ordering MUST be preserved; clients MUST be able to reassemble chunks into the full response in order.
- **NFR-003**: Logs MUST record at least: request id, conversation id, client id, timestamps for stream start/finish, and error details.

### Key Entities

- **Conversation**: logical session grouping messages (id, created_at, participant list).
- **Message**: single user or system message (id, conversation_id, role, content, timestamp).
- **StreamChunk**: an ordered piece of model output (sequence_number, payload, is_final_chunk boolean).
- **ClientSession**: short-lived client connection metadata (client_id, connection_id, ip, user-agent).

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users see the first partial response chunk within 1 second for 95% of typical short prompts under normal load.
- **SC-002**: Streams complete successfully (final chunk received) in 99% of requests under normal load.
- **SC-003**: Cancellation requests are acknowledged within 500ms for 95% of attempts.
- **SC-004**: In a small manual evaluation (n=50), at least 80% of responses are judged coherent and relevant to the prompt/context.

## Assumptions

- An external AI inference provider is available and accessible from the runtime (provider choice is out of scope for this spec).
- Authentication and production-grade rate-limiting are not required for MVP; basic rate-limiting and abuse protections are required.
- Storage of conversation history (if needed) will use a suitable short-term store; long-term persistence is out of scope for MVP.

## Acceptance / Testing Notes

- Use a test client that can accept streaming responses (e.g., SSE, WebSocket, or streaming fetch) to verify chunk ordering and timings.
- Define a set of representative prompts for latency/quality verification (short, medium, long).
- Simulate cancellation and reconnection scenarios to validate behavior.
